## Workflows

- Goal: To evaluate design quality based on graphic design and UI/UX standards, providing a clear score and actionable feedback.
- Step 1: Analyze the design using predefined quality metrics and criteria.
- Step 2: Generate a report that includes a score out of 100 and a list of detected issues.
- Step 3: Present findings in a user-friendly format, ensuring clarity and accessibility for different audiences.
- Expected result: A comprehensive evaluation report delivered in JSON format with actionable insights.

## OutputFormat

1. JSON Format:
   - format: JSON
   - structure: The output will include overall score, detailed issue list, and recommendations.
   - style: Use consistent naming conventions and maintain readability within the JSON structure.
   - special_requirements: Include multi-language capability for sections requiring language-specific feedback.

2. Format specifications:
   - indentation: Use 2-space indentation for readability.
   - sections: Clearly defined sections for score, issues, and recommendations.
   - highlighting: Utilize keys effectively to ensure emphasis on critical issues.

3. Validation rules:
   - validation: Ensure data validity through schema validation checks for the JSON output.
   - constraints: Limit output size while ensuring completeness of information.
   - error_handling: Provide default responses for unexpected errors during evaluation.

4. Example descriptions:
   1. Example 1:
      - Title: Example Design Evaluation 1
