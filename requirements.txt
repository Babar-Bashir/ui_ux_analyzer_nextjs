Website Idea: Automated Graphic/UI-UX Design Evaluation Tool(Social Media)
1. Introduction
This document outlines the concept, functionality, and technical details for a website that allows users to upload design images (JPG, PNG, JPEG, and other formats) and receive an automated evaluation based on graphic design and UI/UX standards.
2. Objective
The main goal is to create an AI-powered tool that analyzes designs for quality, alignment, color scheme, typography, and other UI/UX principles, providing users with a score and detailed feedback along with resources for improvement.
3. Key Features
- Image upload support for JPG, PNG, JPEG, and other common formats.
- Automatic design analysis based on industry-standard graphic design and UI/UX principles.
- Score out of 100 based on detected design quality.
- Detailed list of detected issues with each design.
- Learn More button for each issue linking to relevant educational resources.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users.
- History feature for logged-in users to view past evaluations.
- Multi-language support for global accessibility.
- Secure file handling to ensure user data privacy.
4. Evaluation Criteria
- Element Alignment: Checks if components are properly aligned according to grid systems.
- Icon Quality: Detects low-resolution or pixelated icons.
- Color Scheme: Evaluates if colors match accessibility standards and harmony rules.
- Element Proportion: Checks if elements are balanced and proportionate.
- Typography: Assesses font pairing, readability, and hierarchy.
- Wireframing & Layout: Identifies poor structure or confusing navigation flow.
- Whitespace Usage: Ensures adequate spacing for visual comfort.
- Contrast & Accessibility: Validates WCAG standards for text and background contrast.
- Image Quality: Flags blurry or stretched images.
- Consistency: Ensures style consistency across the design.
- Responsive Design Elements: Simulates smaller screens to check adaptability.
5. Technical Implementation
- Frontend: Built using React.js or Next.js for smooth UI and responsiveness.
- Backend: Node.js/Express.js server handling file uploads and AI processing requests.
- Image Analysis: Use Gemini Pro 2.0 Flash and computer vision models (e.g., OpenCV) to detect alignment, proportions, and icon quality.
- Color & Typography Analysis: Utilize AI libraries (e.g., Colormind API, Google Fonts API) to check for harmony and readability.
- Scoring System: Weighted algorithm assigning points based on severity and number of detected issues.
- Security: Ensure file uploads are scanned for malicious content and deleted after processing.
6. Workflow
- User visits the website and uploads an image.
- Backend receives and processes the image.
- AI models evaluate the design against all criteria.
- A score out of 100 is generated.
- List of detected issues is displayed.
- Each issue has a Learn More button linking to external guides/resources.
- Results are stored for logged-in users.
7. Additional Functionalities
- Integration with design tools (Figma, Adobe XD) for direct project import.
- Side-by-side comparison feature for before/after designs.
- Gamification with badges and streaks for improving design quality.
- Community feedback section where other users can leave comments.
- Dark mode for comfortable use in low-light environments.
8. Conclusion
This platform will serve as a comprehensive, AI-powered design evaluation tool, helping designers improve their skills while ensuring their designs meet professional and accessibility standards.
